This project aims to detect hateful memes using a combination of Vision Transformers (ViT) for image analysis and BERT for text processing. The project involves building a custom model to merge the visual and textual features, followed by the implementation of feature selection techniques like Genetic Algorithm, Firefly Algorithm, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Finally, machine learning classifiers are trained on the selected features to make predictions.
